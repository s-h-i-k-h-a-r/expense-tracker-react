# expense-tracker-react
I have developed an expense tracker app using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
The app incorporates a simple form that allows users to input their expenses, which are stored in the app's state.
The state data is then displayed on the screen, 
and users have the option to filter the expenses by year.
To enhance the user experience, the app also includes a graphical
representation of the expenses, which provides users with a visual overview 
of their spending habits. By utilizing React's component-based architecture,props,form handling and state management, 
the app ensures a smooth and efficient data flow.
